This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error: type mismatches in function parameters. The `bug.ts` file contains code that attempts to pass an array of strings to a function expecting a single string. This causes a runtime error or unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version that addresses the type mismatch and handles the input correctly.
